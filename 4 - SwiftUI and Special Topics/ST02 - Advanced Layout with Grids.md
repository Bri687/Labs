## Objectives

- I can build a simple fixed grid layout with `Grid` and `GridRow`
- I can build a dynamic lazy grid layout with `LazyVGrid` and `LazyHGrid`
- I can use `GridItem` to define the size and behavior of grid rows/columns
- I can define the keyword `lazy` in the context of Swift development and use it to manage performance
