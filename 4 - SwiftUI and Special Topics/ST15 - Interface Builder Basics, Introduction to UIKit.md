## Objectives

- I am able to define what a View is and identify commonly used Views in iOS apps.
- I am able to create an Interface Builder Outlet (@IBOutlet or just Outlet) and describe its purpose.
- I am able to create an Interface Builder Action (@IBAction or just Action) and describe its purpose.
- I am able to open a Storyboard in an Xcode project and describe what it's for.
- I am able to open the Interface Builder's Library and use it to add elements, such as text, buttons, etc, to a Storyboard.
- I am able to change the properties of a UI element, both programmatically (in code) and using the Inspector.
- I am able to define what a Control is and identify commonly used Controls in iOS apps.
- I am able to define what a UIViewController class is and what it is used for.


## Lesson Outline

Cover _Swift Fundamentals 1.9: Interface Builder Basics_ and _2.8: Introduction to UIKit_

**Suggested Activities:**
- Drill students on creating @IBOutlets and @IBActions; have them practice disconnecting them
- Show students how to cause common errors, especially `'NSInvalidArgumentException', unrecognized selector sent to instance` and `NSUnknownKeyException', reason: '[ setValue:forUndefinedKey:]: this class is not key value coding-compliant for the key [key]`, caused by broken outlet connections.
