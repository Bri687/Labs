## Objectives

- I can describe the Test-Driven Development methodology and why it is useful for individuals and companies
- I can describe the (minor) difference between Test-first and Test-driven development
- I can add tests to an Xcode project using the `XCTest` framework
- I can define the term _assertion_ in the context of testing and create assertions
- I can define the _Red/Green/Refactor_ cycle and use it to guide my test-driven development
- I can use Test-Driven Development to write tests, then code that passes those tests, through the entire development process


## Lesson Materials

- [ST18 - TDD - What is TDD, Red-Green-Refactor.key](../4%20-%20SwiftUI%20and%20Special%20Topics/Materials/ST18%20-%20TDD%20-%20What%20is%20TDD,%20Red-Green-Refactor.key)


## Lesson Outline

- Cover [TDD - What is TDD, Red-Green-Refactor.key](./Materials/Test%20Driven%20Development/TDD%20-%20What%20is%20TDD%2C%20Red-Green-Refactor.key)

Suggested Activities:
- Teacher can go through the steps of the lab as a whole class, using the `Person` examples in the slides, then ask them to do it again in their pairs with a different model object.
- Consider simplifying the lab by giving students a specific model object to build in their pairs (other than the `Person` example)
