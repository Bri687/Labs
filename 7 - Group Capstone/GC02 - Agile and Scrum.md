## Lesson Materials

- [GC02 - Agile and Scrum.key](../7%20-%20Group%20Capstone/Materials/GC02%20-%20Agile%20and%20Scrum.key)


## Lesson Outline

- Cover [Agile and Scrum.key](./Agile%20and%20Scrum.key)
  - Goal is just a basic introduction to the terms and structure.
  - Students do not need to use Scrum Agile to manage their group capstone, but need to have a firm understanding of what it is and what it would look like if they were going to.

Suggested Activities:
- Have students participate in a role-play for each Scrum ceremony for an imaginary company working on an example app
- Give students a narrative description of what your experience with Scrum has been like/currently is like. ("At my company we do stand ups at 7:30, they're usually very boring, our sprints are 3 weeks, we come with an agenda..." etc.)
