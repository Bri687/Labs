## Objectives

- I can participate in a daily stand-up meeting.


## Lesson Outline

**Goal:** Walk students through a daily stand-up.

- Teams will practice doing daily stand-ups by taking turns while other groups watch, using their projects as a basis. Instructor will act as the group's facilitator.

- Students don't need to rigorously enact a true Scrum stand up; the goal is just to familiarize them with the terminology and encourage them to meet every morning before working on their projects independently.
