| 07:30 - 09:00 | Guided Work |


## Objectives

- I can use Trello or a similar management program to create and refine a Scrum board and project backlog
- I can participate in a Sprint planning meeting, including making a Sprint backlog


## Lesson Outline

## Goal: Demo for students what a Trello board looks like by creating a backlog, then a roleplaying a sprint planning meeting

## Notes

We're emphasizing Trello for this lesson as it seems decently likely that students will encounter it in the industry. If the instructor would prefer to have students use GitHub Projects/JIRA/something else, feel free.

Students are not required to create a project board for their group projects (though they can if they like). The main goal is to feel confident when joining a real Scrum/Agile team in the future.

## Outline

1. Give a brief overview of Trello.
2. Walk teams through how to create a Scrum board, how to organize it, etc. Feel free to use one of the Group Capstone Projects as an example project, or make one up.
3. With a few volunteers students through a Sprint planning meeting.
4. Review the role of these techniques in the industry and why it's important for them to be familiar.
