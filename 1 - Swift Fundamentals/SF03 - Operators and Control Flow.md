## Objectives

- I can use `==`, `>=`, `<=`, `>`, `<`, and `!=` to compare two values and understand the purpose of doing so
- I can use an `if` statement to control the flow of my code
- I can use a `switch` statement to control the flow of my code
- I can perform basic mathematical operations on numeric variables, such as `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and `%`
- I can use ternary operators (`? :`) to condense simple if statements


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Fundamentals 1.4 - Operators_ and _Swift Fundamentals 1.5 - Control Flow_

Suggested Activities:
- The slideshow does not cover modulo (%), so make sure to go over it with students.
- Instructor writes several if-else and switch statements based on random real world scenarios (e.g. "If hunger > 5, cook meal; else, have snack"); convert an if statement into a switch statement and vice versa; then, have students work in pairs to generate examples of their own.
