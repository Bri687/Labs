## Objectives

- Objective


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Data Collections 2.1: Closures_ and _2.2: Extensions_

Suggested Activities:
- Before starting into the chapter, look at some of the places where we have used closures already, especially .map() and related functions.
- Review the equivalent terms in other languages, including anonymous function and lambda, mentioning that while other languages may distinguish between these and closures, in Swift they're all called closures.
- Help students find some practical uses for extending base types, such as adding an .isNotEmpty property to String, etc.
