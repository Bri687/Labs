# #3 - Calculator Project Requirements - Due Sep 19, 2025

Your overall goal is to recreate the functionality of an actual calculator as possible while using functions in the place of buttons. To that end, your mathematical functions must not accept any parameters. Instead, you must have one function for inputting a value, then "press" the other functions for adding, subtracting, multiplying, dividing, invert sign (+/-) and percentage, as well as C/AC to clear the current value. Use print statements to output the running total of the calculator.

## Black Diamond

- Make a function representing the percent button work as expected
- Add a UI to this project using SwiftUI
