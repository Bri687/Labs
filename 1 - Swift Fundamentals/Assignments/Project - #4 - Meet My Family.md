# #4 - Meet My Family Project Requirements - Due Oct 7, 2025

## Instructions
1. Create an app that introduces us to not only yourself, but your family as well. (If needed you can include friends instead/in addition).
2. Create a dashboard screen that shows us your family as a whole. Each family member should have a picture and a name.
3. Tapping on a family member should display a modal sheet with more details on that person. You can choose what details to include.
4. Once a family member has been viewed, display a green checkmark ✅ next to their name.
