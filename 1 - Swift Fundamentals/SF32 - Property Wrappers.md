- I can use `@Observable` to make classes and structs able trigger UI updates
- I can use `@Environment` and `.environment()` to pass data down the view heirarchy
- I can define what it means to bind a property and when it is necessary
- I can bind properties in standard SwiftUI views that require it using the `$` prefix
- I can use `@Bindable` to make an `@Observable` model bindable
- I can distinguish when to use each of the previously used property wrappers and when they may be intercheangable
