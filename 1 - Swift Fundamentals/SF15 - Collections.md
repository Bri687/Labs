## Objectives

- Learn and understand what an Array is
- Learn and understand what a Dictionary is


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Fundamentals 2.6 - Collections_

Suggested Activities:
- On the whiteboard, diagram several array and dictionary initializations, including dictionaries that contain arrays and dictionaries that contain dictionaries, so that students can see where their types, keys, and values are declared. For example:
  - `var users: [User] = []`
  - `let dictionary = ["Bird", ["a warm-blooded egg-laying vertebrate distinguished by the possession of feathers, wings, and a beak and (typically) by being able to fly.", "a person of a specified kind or character."]`
