## Objectives

- I can briefly describe what SwiftUI is, its unique qualities, and how it compares and contrasts to UIKit
- I can define the terms `imperative` and `declarative` syntax and describe what makes SwiftUI declarative
- I can create a struct that conforms to SwiftUI's `View` protocol and place UI in its `body` computed property
- I can definite the `some` keyword and describe its role in building SwiftUI views
- I can implement basic SwiftUI views, including `VStack`, `HStack`, `ZStack`, `Text`, `Button`, `Color`, and `Spacer`
- I can define the term _View Modifier_ and identify them in SwiftUI code
- I can use several basic view modifiers including `.foregroundStyle()`, `.border()`, `.padding()`, and `.background()`
- I can describe why the order of view modifiers matters and how it impacts the way views are changed by them
