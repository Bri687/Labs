## Objectives

- I can use `guard` statements simply to take the place of `if` statements for better readability
- I can use `guard-let` statements to unwrap optionals
- I can state how the scope of unwrapped optionals differs between `if-let` and `guard-let` statements
- I can create an `enum` and describe its basic purpose
- I can use `enum`s in combination with `switch` statements and describe what is useful about the combination
- I can add raw values to `enum` cases


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Fundamentals_ 3.4: Guard

Suggested Activities:
- Think-Pair-Share: What is the purpose of a guard? Give one example.
- Ask students in pairs to create a function `launchRocket() -> Bool` and (in psuedocode) write a whole bunch of guard statements in a row.
  - Then, ask students to change all the guards to if-statements so they can compare and contrast how they work.
