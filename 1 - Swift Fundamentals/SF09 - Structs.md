## Objectives

- I am able to describe the basic purpose of Structs and Classes.
- I am able to describe what a reference type is.
- I am able to describe what a value type is.
- I am able to create a custom class with properties, initializers, and methods
- I am able to use inheritance to create subclasses.


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Fundamentals 2.4 - Structures_

Suggested Activities
- Ask students to generate a list of examples of data that might need to be stored and retrieved in an app. Have them look through their own installed apps and think about what kinds of structs might be used there.
- Guide students through building structs for String/Int/Double/etc to connect them to the idea that these types are structs and that they can build their own
- Show students structs from a real project
