## Objectives

- I can define what an optional is and its purpose.
- I can create an optional in code.
- I can create a failable initializer, state its purpose, and describe what happens when it fails.
- I can unwrap an optional using the if-let pattern, and can define what it means to unwrap an optional
- I can use optional chaining to unwrap or access multiple optionals at once
- I can use "!" to implicitly unwrap an optional, state what will happen if it fails, and state when it is not appropriate to use one


## Lesson Outline

- Topic: Review Optionals
- Make sure there's time for students to finish and submit Optionals lab

Suggested Activities:
- Have students prepare a playground that demonstrates each objective listed above, with comments
- Have students review their notes (or take notes on the book) and then quiz them

May also use the ones from previous lesson if we didn't already:
- Ask students in groups to generate a list of examples where Nil and 0 or Nil and "" mean different things.
- Ask students to generate similes/metaphors/analogies similar to the one provided by the book (Optionals are like a Box)
- Ask students to visually map out optionals, optional chaining, force unwrapping, if-lets in a [concept map](https://d2slcw3kip6qmk.cloudfront.net/marketing/pages/chart/seo/concept-maps/discovery/mind-maps.svg)
