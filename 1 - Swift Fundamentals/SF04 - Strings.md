## Objectives

- I can create `String` variables
- I can use string interpolation to add data into a `String`.
- I can compare two strings to see if they are identical using `==` or `!=`
- I can identify what a function is and what it does
- I can create a function that takes input parameters and returns a value
- I can use the `String` type's methods to do things like create a lowercased version of a string, check the presence of a prefix or suffix in a string, or get the count of characters in a string.
- I can describe what Unicode is and state that Strings can contain any unicode character (including symbols and 😃 emoji)
