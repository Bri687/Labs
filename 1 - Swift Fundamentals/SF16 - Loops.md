## Objectives

- Learn about the different types of loops
- Understand the use case for each type of loop


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Fundamentals 3.7 - Loops_

Suggested Activities:
- Help students understand the `for in` syntax as "**For** each item **in** this list of items, do this:"
- Human Interpreter activity: Have students manually evaluate several example loops (perhaps generated by LLM) to find a result at the end. For example:
  - Without running it in Xcode, what will "result" be after this loop?
      ```
      var result = 1
      let numbers = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
      for (index, num) in numbers.enumerated() {
          if index % 2 == 0 {
              result *= num
          } else {
              result += num
          }
      }
      ```
