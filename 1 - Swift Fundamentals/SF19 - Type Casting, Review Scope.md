## Objectives

- I can use `as?` along with if-let statements to get an object of a specific type, if possible
- I can use `as!` to force cast an object to a specific type and understand what will happen if it fails
- I can use the `is` type check operator to check the type of a variable
- I can use the `Any` type to store objects regardless of type, then use Type Casting to use them with their actual Type
- I can identify the scope of a variable and explain why scope is a useful and necessary concept
- I can define and use variable shadowing to create new variables with the same name as ones used outside the local scope


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Fundamentals 3.3: Type Casting and Inspection_
- Review _Swift Fundamentals 3.5: Scope_

Our previous lesson on Scope introduced the concept, but there are more applications for variable shadowing with loops, optionals, and type casting to review and they are now ready to complete their scope lab.

Suggested Activities:
- Use a "think aloud" to walk students through the "why" of type casting alongside the how in a practical code example
- Have students draw a diagram representing the scope of variables in a real code snippet. This would also require identifying all the constants & variables in a snippet (thus finding things like the control variable in a for-loop or new constants created by if-lets)
