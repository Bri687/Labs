## Objectives

- I can define what a `delegate` is
- I can adopt existing Swift/UIKit delegate protocols such as `UITextFieldDelegate`
- I can create a delegate protocol (which is not different than a regular one, but is a specific purpose for a protocol)
- I can build a delegator/delegate connection between two classes


## Lesson Outline

- Cover [Delegates.key](./Materials/Delegates.key)
  - Please feel free to add to / suggest additions to this keynote.
 
Suggested activities:
- In small groups, have students create a shared document that teaches other students what delegation is and how to use them.
