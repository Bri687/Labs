- I can use a `NavigationLink` to create simple buttons that display new views within a `NavigationStack`
- I can hide the navigation bar in a `NavigationStack`
- I can programatically dismiss a view using the `dismiss` environment function
- I can use `.sheet(isPresented:)` to display a modal view
- I can use `TabView` to embed multiple views in tabs and compare it to `UITabBarController`
