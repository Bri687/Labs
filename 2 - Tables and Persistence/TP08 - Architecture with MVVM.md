## Objectives

- I can define the term _architecture_ in the context of app development and describe why it's important to consider architecture
- I can define the architectural style generally used in UIKit, "MVC"
- I can identify a few different potential architectures applicable to SwiftUI
- I can state what the acronym _MVVM_ stands for
- I can describe advantages and disadvantages to using MVVM
- I can describe similarities to and differences from MVC in MVVM
- I can use MVVM in SwiftUI by creating and using ViewModel objects.


## Lesson Materials

- [TP08 - SwiftUI - Architecture.key](../2%20-%20Tables%20and%20Persistence/Materials/TP08%20-%20SwiftUI%20-%20Architecture.key)


## Lesson Outline

- Cover [SwiftUI - Architecture.key](./Materials/SwiftUI/SwiftUI%20-%20Architecture.key)

# Suggested Activities
- Have an open ended discussion prior to the lesson on other times in life where architecture is important or a drawback. Examples might include outlining an essay, structuring a workplace, or planning a wedding.
- Make sure students understand that architecture is optional in the sense that they have different architectures to choose from, or can write spaghetti code and worry about it later. (Might not be the best option but it is an option!)
