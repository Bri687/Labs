## Objectives

- I can describe why the `Codable` protocol is important when saving data
- I can encode some data using an Encoder like `PropertyListEncoder` and describe the purpose of doing so
- I can use `FileManager` to create a full file path and can state what a file path is
- I can use the `.write(to:options:)` method of encoded data to write that data to the disk
- I can fetch some data from the disk using the `Data(contentsOf:)` initializer with a file path
- I can use `PropertyListDecoder` to decode some data and state the purpose of doing so


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Data Collections 1.7: Saving Data_

Suggested Activities:
- Take some time for students to take notes on the vocabulary of data storage:
  - Encode/Decode
  - Persist
  - Disk
  - Write/Read
  - Data
  - Serialization
  - Sandbox
- Have students draw visual representations/diagrams of the steps required to write and retrieve data.
