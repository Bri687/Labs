## Objectives

- I can define the term **protocol** and state why protocols are used.
- I can **adopt** and **conform** to common Swift protocols such as `Equatable` and `Codable`.
- I can create my own protocol, and understand some common uses for doing so
- I can define the term **delegation** at a broad level (we will learn more about them as we go).


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Data Collections 1.1 - Protocols_.

**Suggested Activities:**
- Have students use their knowledge of common protocols to quickly recreate one or more of Swift's existing protocols. For example:
```
protocol MyCustomStringConvertible {
    var description: String { get }
}
```
- Show students protocols you've used in your code.
- Today may be a good time to clearly define the term "API." It's not key to today's lesson but relevant to the unit as a whole.
