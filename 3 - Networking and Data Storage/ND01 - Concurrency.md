## Objectives

- I can define the term concurrency and describe the basics of how a processor executes code on different threads
- I can explain what `DispatchQueue.main.async` does and what the main thread is
- I can identify when code needs to be run on the main thread and how to do so
- I can describe what a secure HTTP connection is and how to resolve errors related to insecure connections
- I can use network activity indicators to represent network activity to end users


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Data Collections 2.6: Concurrency_

Suggested Activities:
- This lesson relies heavily on the previous two lessons, so spend extra time reviewing them before moving on to this chapter.
- Review how a multi core processor works, what threads are, what race conditions are, and why we need to think about the order functions are executed.
  - One fun activity could be having students roleplay as a processor. Have one group of four students compete against an individual student to complete a list of math problems and use this as an analogy for concurrency.
- Have students visually annotate or diagram the code on page 459. Screenshot of what this might look like in Freeform is included below. Encourage students to annotate as much information as possible (and is still relevant to the lesson).
