## Objectives

- I can state some of the rationale provided by the HIG for why animations are important
- I can use a ternary operator combined with SwiftUI view modifiers to change the size (or other values) of a `View`
- I can use the .animation(_:, value:) view modifier to create simple animations that occur when a value tied to a View's property, such as its frame or another variable, changes.
- I can use the duration and delay properties to change the timing of animations.
- I can use the withAnimation function in SwiftUI to animate any changes to variables made inside of its closure
- I can create advanced animations using `.spring` or `.interpolatingSpring` and their parameters
- I can use `.onAppear` and `.task` to run code when a view first appears on screen (and describe the minor difference between them)
- I can use `withAnimation`'s completion closure to chain animations together or run other code
