## Objectives

- I can describe the purpose and benefits of using generics, including why Swift requires them unlike other non-type-safe languages
- I can identify and use the syntax of generic types and methods (for example, `<T>`, as well as the `where` keyword)
- I can describe how generics work in protocols, including the use of the `associatedtype` keyword
- I can describe the advantages of using generics in combination with protocols


## Lesson Outline

- Cover _Swift Data Collections 3.2: Swift Generics_

Suggested Activities:
- Show students some Objective-C or JavaScript or something and show how generics only make sense in a type safe language, and help students understand that the hoops they jump through to use Generics is a strength of Swift, not an arbitrary complication.
