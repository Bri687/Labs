## Objectives

- I can state how CoreData and SwiftData are related to each other and what makes SwiftData different than CoreData
- I can use the "Convert to SwiftData" option on an `.xcdatamodel` file and resolve common errors in conversion that may arise
- I can use `@Model` to make a class SwiftData compatible
- I can mark a property with `@Attribute` to set its SwiftData settings, such as making it `.unique`
- I can create relationships between SwiftData models with default relatioship behavior
- I can create relationships using `@Relationship` to define custom relationship behavior
- I can avoid errors in relationships by marking properties optional and defining relationships post-initialization
- I can create a `ModelContainer` with custom `ModelConfiguration` properties and add it to the environment using the `.modelContainer()` modifier
- I can use `ModelContext`'s `.insert()` method to add an instance of a model into the context so it persists
- I can use `ModelContext`'s `.save()` method to override the autosave functionality (and know to use it sparingly)
- I can use `@Query` to pull stored data from the model context and use its settings to configure predicates and sorting


## Lesson Materials

- [ND09 - 1-SwiftData vs CoreData.key](../3%20-%20Networking%20and%20Data%20Storage/Materials/ND09%20-%201-SwiftData%20vs%20CoreData.key)


## Lesson Outline

- Cover [CoreData: SwiftData.key](./Materials/Core%20Data/Core%20Data%20-%20SwiftData.key)

**Suggested Activities:**
- Have students start by reading the documentation before diving into the lesson
- Have students try making a new SwiftData project and walk them through the autogenerated code before going through the slides
- Walk students through building a SwiftData project from scratch using [the Animal data entry example in the SwiftData docs](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/adding-and-editing-persistent-data-in-your-app) (including the steps on [this page on Enums](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftdata/defining-data-relationships-with-enumerations-and-model-classes))
