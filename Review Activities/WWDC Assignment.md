# WWDC Assignment

## Overview
Each year, Apple's WWDC conference features several instructional sessions designed to teach developers about Swift development concepts, with an emphasis on new features but also some on old ones.

For this assignment, we'd like you to pick one WWDC presentation that interests you and review it.

## Instructions

Watch a WWDC session of your choosing and code along with it. Take notes as you watch as well. On the due date for this assignment, you will quickly (1 minute or less) explain:

1. What the session you watched was about
2. What you learned from it and why/how it will be useful to you in the future.

You will submit your code as proof of your assignment completion.
