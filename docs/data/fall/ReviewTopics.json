    "body" : "Today we will continue our mini lessons on Git by learning about the git add and commit command. First, we need to review the three parts of Git: Working Directory, Index, and Repository.\nWorking Directory: The folder on your computer where you are hosting your Git Repository; reflects the current version you are editing.\nIndex: The list of changes you have made since the last version was committed. You must _stage_ your changes to indicate you want to save them next time you commit. You do this using the `add` command.\nRepository: The .git folder which holds information about your repository and all previous data\/versions you have committed in the past, including branches.\n Now, let's practice making a change and committing it to save a new version.\n1. Navigate to a git repository (the one from yesterday works or you can make a new one) in terminal (reminder to use `cd` and `ls` to navigate).\n2. Add a file to this folder (either in finder or using `touch File.txt`). Your _working directory_ now includes changes from your last commit that are not yet stored in the repository.\n3. You must now _stage_ your change by _add_ing the change to the _index_. While you can pick and choose which changes to commit, for now let's just do `add .`; this means \"stage all changes in the current directory\".\n4. Finally, we _commit_ those changes to the _repo_ to save this version of your code. Type `git commit -m \"your message\", with your message being a descriptive comment of what changed in this version of your code. In this case it might be something simple like \"Added File.txt to repo.\"",

Navigate to a git repository.\n2. Open File.txt from yesterday (or make the file if you haven't) and add some text to it. (You can open it quickly from terminal by typing `open File.txt`.)\n3. In Terminal type `git status`. You should see information about what changes you have made and whether or not they are staged yet.\n4. Type `git add .`, then run `git status` again. You should see that the changes you made are now staged.\n5. Type `git commit -m \"edited File.txt\"`. Then, run `git log`. You should see a history of all the commits you have made so far.

So far, you have learned how to create a repository and add commits to save versions of your code as you go. But what if you want to actually access those previous versions? To do this we use `git checkout`. You can remember the purpose of this function if you think of it as temporarily \"checking out\" a previous version from your \"library\" of versions.\n1. In Terminal, navigate to the git repository you have been practicing in.\n2. Use `git log` to view the history of commits. Select a commit you want to go back to and copy its hash identifier. Then close the log.\n3. Run `git checkout 28af83402h`, replacing the hash with the one you copied. (Note: You can use just the first few characters of the hash--you don't have to copy the whole thing). This will change your working directory to match the state it was in when you made that commit. In this way it's very similar to loading a save file in a video game--you are warped back to that point in time.\n4. To return to the most recent commit, type `git checkout main`.

For convenience, you can also combine these steps with `git checkout -b name-of-branch` (with the -b indicating that a new branch should be created).\n- To switch back to the main branch, type `git checkout main`.",
