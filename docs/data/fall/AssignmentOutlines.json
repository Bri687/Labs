If you're unfamililar, a quick Google search will show you what they are and examples of similar apps. Follow the steps below to complete your project.\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. Create a new Playground titled MadLibGenerator.\n2. Create a function called generateMadLib() that returns a String. We will add its parameters in a moment.\n3. Find, write, or generate a one paragraph story for which you will have your users fill in blanks. In your function, return this paragraph as a String.\n4. Use String Interpolation to fill the blanks in your paragraph with parameters from your function signature, where users can input their own words. For example, you might delete an existing noun and have a parameter called noun of type String to replace it. If you have more than one noun\/adjective\/etc, you can add a number to the end (noun1, noun2, etc).\n5. Test your function. By calling generateMadLib(noun:,adjective:) (or whatever parameters you wound up with), you should get back your paragraph with the chosen words substituted.\n6. We should make sure the user has entered valid strings so their mad lib turns out properly. Using an if-else statement, make sure that all input parameters are not empty strings, and if they are, return a String that says \"Invalid Input\".\n7. For the final step, it might be more interesting if the user gets back a random story each time. At the top of your function, add a constant called randomStorySelection of type Int, and assign it a random number from 1 to 3 by setting it to Int.random(in: 1...3).\n8. Add a switch statement that switches on randomStorySelection to choose which story to return, then add two new stories in addition to your first. Without more advanced techniques or splitting into multiple functions, these two additional stories will need to have the same number and types of blanks to fill in.\n9. Test your Mad Lib generator by having a partner call your function in your playground and see the result.\n\n## Black Diamond\n\nIt might be even more fun if the order of the different words is randomized as well, so that, for instance, the nouns a user provided may appear in any order in the story. Find a way to randomize this order.\n\n## Rubric\n\n- Student has just one function that takes several parts of speech as input and generates three or more randomized Mad Lib stories as output.\n- Passing invalid input (i.e. empty strings) returns an error string."

Use Text view modifiers to arrange and style your profile to reflect your unique style.\nSince this assignment will require you to choose custom fonts, you may want to open the Font Book app installed on your Mac, where you can view a list of the fonts available on Mac and iOS by default.\nIf you would like to change the background color of each of these views, you can do so by changing the colors listed in each #Preview macro at the bottom of the page.\n1. Create three structs that conform to View: ProfileView, TopFiveFriendsView, and BlogPostView. This will fix the errors\n2. To see a preview of how each view will look in the app, make sure you have opened your canvas (Option + Command + Return). You can view each struct you've created by clicking on the tabs at the top of the canvas.\n3. Create a profile view with Text elements for each of the following items: Username, Real Name, Home City, and Bio. Style each of them appropriately with custom fonts, font sizes, and colors for each. Feel free to add any additional modifiers as well.\n4. Create a TopFiveFriends view with a list of your friends, ranked in order of favorite to least favorite. (Don't worry, we won't tell them). Use a different font and color for each person, and include an Emoji to represent each one as well.\n5. Create a BlogPostView. Give your blog post a title, a date posted, a body, and a display of number of likes and comments. Once again, style each individually with fonts, font sizes, and colors, and any other modifiers you would like.\n6. Try running the app. You should see all three views embedded in Tabs (the code for this is in SwiftUITextLabApp.swift). You may need to adjust the style slightly to accommodate the Tab Bar at the bottom of the screen.\n\n## Black Diamond\n\n7. Add one or more Image views to each page.\n8. Use Stack views to arrange your content more dynamically.\n\n## Rubric\n\n- App has a profile view with Username, Real Name, Home City, and Bio, appropriately filled out and styled.\n- App has a Top Five Friends screen with emoji, fonts, and colors for each friend.\n- App has a blog post view with a title, a date posted, a body, and a number of likes and comments.

While you haven't implemented the AR features just yet, you need to prep some UI for an investor meeting. Your boss's instructions are:\n\n“We need a DragonDex companion app by tomorrow. Players should be able to swipe through dragons, dive into their stats, read a list of special powers, and tweak the app’s theme color. Keep navigation pristine—one SwiftUI Router, zero spaghetti. Go!”\n\n\nBuild a router that will allow you to navigate through four screens:\n* Dragon List - Scrollable gallery of dragons (name & thumbnail).\n* Dragon Detail - Big artwork, species, lore snippet, fire rating, or whatever other data you want to include.\n* Powers List - Button on the detail screen pushes on a view that lists the dragons abilities (e.g., Inferno Burst, Sky Dive).\n* Settings - Gear icon on the dragon list screen opens a screen with a color picker which changes the background color of every screen.\n\nThe UI of the screens themselves can be barebones. The important thing is demonstrating your ability to build a router.\n\n## Black Diamond\n\n* Add a Tab Bar\n    * Tab 1 – Dragons (existing flow)\n    * Tab 2 – Riders (list of dragon riders → Rider Detail).\n\n* \tMultiple Routers\n    * \tMainRouter – handles tab switching + Settings sheet presentation.\n    * \tDragonsRouter – drives the DragonDex flow.\n    * \tRidersRouter – drives the rider flow.\n\n* \tSettings as a Sheet – Present the Settings screen modally through the MainRouter.\n\n"
