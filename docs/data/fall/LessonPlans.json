The main goal is to feel confident when joining a real Scrum\/Agile team in the future.\n\n## Outline\n\n1. Give a brief overview of Trello.\n2. Walk teams through how to create a Scrum board, how to organize it, etc. Feel free to use one of the Group Capstone Projects as an example project, or make one up.\n3. With a few volunteers students through a Sprint planning meeting.\n4. Review the role of these techniques in the industry and why it's important for them to be familiar.",
