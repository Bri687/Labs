## Exercise - LocalizedError
 
 A better approach to the previous exercise might be using the LocalizedError protocol, so that the printed output of each error is contained in a `errorDescription` property. Using the error messages you created in the last step, change `CommunicationError` to conform to `LocalizedError`. Add an `errorDescription` computed String property, switching on self to return the appropriate message.

    case unknown

            return "Communication error: The network service is currently unavailable."
